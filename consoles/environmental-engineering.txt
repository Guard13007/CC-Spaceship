TODO: rearrange the order of symbols because some are blocked by the keypad itself

= in top left allows selecting a different console (is blue-colored)
 ENV ENGINEER. text is cyan color

color codes:
black bg, no fg     -> system does not exist
red bg              -> system destroyed
otherwise, black bg
white fg            -> system is not damaged
green fg            -> system is damaged but operational
orange fg           -> system is damaged, relying on auxiliary system
red fg              -> system does not have auxiliary or auxiliary is also inoperable

symbols:
*   system is operating at normal settings
-   system is operating normally, at a below normal setting
+   system is operating normally, at a higher than normal setting
.   system requires more power to function properly
o   system is overloaded and taking damage from too much power supplied to it
