F = foreward shields, A = aft shields, W = warp drive / navigational deflector,
I = impulse engines / thrusters, S = sensors, P = phasers, T = photon/quantum
torpedoes, C = comms, R = reactor
TODO: may reorganize placement, so some systems are more to the right, as the
 right indicator colors are for those systems + reactor, left are for the
 remaining ones

= in top left allows selecting a different console (is blue-colored)
 ENGINEERING text is cyan color

bg -> normal power is yellow, not enough power is red, more than needed is green
bg, for reactor -> green is normal operating range, red is overwhelmed, yellow is
 nearing overwhelmed, orange is below minimum
